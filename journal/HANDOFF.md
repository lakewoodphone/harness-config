# HANDOFF — state of play, newest first

**Rule:** newest entry at the top. Every session that changed anything writes one before ending.
Format is fixed so a future self can skim it in seconds:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM · <host> · <one-line title>
CHANGED     what is now different in the world
IN FLIGHT   what is unfinished, and where the thread is
BROKEN      what is known-broken right now
NEXT        the single most useful next action
EVIDENCE    files, commits, or commands that prove the above

## 2026-09-11 · ZABZ-YOGA · Built the conversational CEO and its memory

**VERIFIED STATE (both workstations, checked not assumed)**
- `zabz` is the default preset on **ZABZ-YOGA and ZABZ-TECH**; second sync run on each is fully clean.
- Model is **`deepseek-flash`** on both (reverted; see the correction below).
- `zabz` is **25 rows**: full toolbelt + background-first shell policy + **6 MCP bridges**
  (secretary, firecrawl, jina, context7, fetch, playwright).
- Mount validation: **`mounted OK: zabz`**.
- **The MCP servers genuinely spawn** — proven by process tree, not assumption. DSH pid 11744 had
  children running `ps_mcp_server.py`, `mcp_launcher.py`, `mcp-fetch-server` and the Playwright MCP.
- `ceo-kernel` Phase 1 runs on `secratary` and its sentinel found two things manual analysis missed.

**CHANGED, THEN REVERTED — read before touching model settings**
The default model was briefly switched to `deepseek-v4-pro` on the assumption that "pro" meant more
capable. **The owner corrected it: 4.1 Flash is better and cheaper.** Verified afterwards: the API
advertises only `deepseek-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash` is rejected by name,
and Flash and Pro returned byte-identical usage on an identical probe. Reverted. LESSONS L25–L27:
do not change a cost-bearing default on a hunch.

**THE ONE THING STILL UNPROVEN**
The preset default is chosen **at session start**, so `settings.yaml` saying `zabz` does not mean any
running session uses it. `self_audit` showed the live session on `cordis` because the DSH process
started one second before the settings were written. **A profile restart is required**, and a real
session on `zabz` has still never been observed. First check after restarting: `self_audit` should
report the agent's preset as `zabz`, and the tool catalog should include `mcp__secretary__ps_*`.

**ALSO FOUND — the running process does not hot-reload the preset default**
The model namespace *does* re-read per request (a model change applied live), but the **preset** is
fixed at session start. Recorded as PAIN P11: a change can be reported as done while having no
effect. Rule adopted: no claim about a preset without a live agent reporting that preset.

**IN FLIGHT**
- `zabz` is installed and defaulted on **both** workstations (Yoga and desktop), each verified with a
  clean second sync run. A **profile restart** is required for the default to take effect.
- **The one unproven thing: the secretary MCP row's 14 tools have not been observed registering in a
  live session.** What *is* proven: the preset mounts (`mounted OK: zabz`); the row resolves
  **enabled** on win32 (`disabled: !!js process.platform !== 'win32'` evaluates false); both paths
  exist; the venv python imports the `mcp` SDK; the `dsh-mcp-client` package is present (0.1.5-rc.2);
  and an independent handshake against `ps_mcp_server.py` returned all 14 tools. What is *not* proven
  is that the client completes that handshake at preset mount time and registers them. **First session
  on `zabz` should list its tools** — if `mcp__secretary__ps_*` is absent, this is the thread to pull.
- `ceo-kernel` is staged on `secratary` at `/home/zabz/ceo-kernel` and runs, but **not scheduled** —
  it only runs when invoked. Phase 1 is complete; Phases 2–7 (inbox, ledger, gate, preset tools,
  daemon, evolution loop) are designed in `ceo-kernel/docs/DESIGN.md` and not built.

**BROKEN / KNOWN**
- Three divergent `secretary.db` copies; nothing yet prevents writes to a stale replica (PAIN P3).
- Evolution loop still not closing: 56 unapplied, 30 duplicates, 13 node_modules targets (PAIN P4).
- `engineering_indexer`: 172 ticks, 0 completions (PAIN P5).
- 7 critical + 46 urgent messages held undelivered (PAIN P6).
- `harness-config` sync is **manual**. Nothing schedules it, so drift resumes the moment someone
  forgets to run it. A scheduled pull is a small, high-value fix.

**NEXT**
Open a session on `zabz` and confirm the tool list — specifically whether `mcp__secretary__ps_*`
appears. That closes the only open verification, and it is the difference between a CEO that can talk
and one that can act on the company.

**EVIDENCE**
- `~/code/harness-config/presets/zabz/agent.cordis.yml` (20 rows)
- `~/code/ceo-kernel/ck/{provenance,sources,sentinel,cli}.py`
- `~/code/personal-secretary-mvp/docs/secretary-replacement-audit/` (7 documents)
- Sentinel run on `secratary`: 4 findings, including `engineering_indexer` dead weight and a
  131-day-old question — both new discoveries
