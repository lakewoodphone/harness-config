"""phone-gate.py — any URL that reaches the harness signs you in, first time, by itself.

The problem this solves, measured 2026-09-11: the harness authenticates with a one-time `?token=` on `GET /`
only. A first-time visitor who reaches the root *without* that token — a typed address, a browser
autocomplete, an old bookmark — gets a **plain-text 401** (`dsh web authentication required; reopen the URL
printed by dsh web`). iOS then offers that text as a download, so the owner saw "a document it wants me to
download". A dead end, caused by which URL he happened to use.

So this sits between Tailscale Serve and the engine and peeks at the first request:

  * a browser asking for the document (`/`) with no harness cookie and no token  ->  302 to `/?token=<live>`
  * everything else (the token exchange, assets, the REST API, the WebSocket)     ->  relayed byte-for-byte

It is a raw TCP relay, not an HTTP proxy, and that is the point: WebSocket upgrade (`/api/remote.mux`,
which carries every streamed reply) passes through untouched because the bytes are never parsed. Only the
first request line and headers are inspected; after that the connection is a pipe.

The token is read from the engine's log at request time, so it survives engine restarts.

    Two bugs lived here, both of the same family — trusting a proxy-shaped assumption

    1. The first version checked whether credentials were *present*: a `dsh-auth-`
       cookie or a `token=` in the query meant "authenticated, relay it". Both are
       worthless when stale, and stale is the normal state of a link saved on a phone.
    2. It inspected only the first request on a connection. Serve pools connections,
       so later requests bypassed every check here.

    And one design correction, forced by a measurement: redirecting the visitor to
    `/?token=<live>` cannot be made safe. A client that keeps a bad cookie - curl -H,
    or a browser refusing cookies - refollows for ever: measured 50 hops and a curl
    abort. The engine accepts a live token even when a stale cookie is present, so
    instead of redirecting, the gate now adds the token to the request it forwards and
    passes the engine's own 303 through. One hop, no client-visible token in the URL or
    the browser's history, and a per-client cooldown bounds the case where even that
